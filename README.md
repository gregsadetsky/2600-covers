# 2600-covers

## TLDR

I randomly remembered a 2600 Magazine cover from 1997 and decided to make a thing about it.

## give me the goods

[Here are all of 2600's covers](COVERS.md)

## why?

I was riding the escalator on the [Lexington Avenueâ€“53rd Street station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Avenue/51st_Street_station#IND_Queens_Boulevard_Line_platform) and noticed two LED signs that were not functioning.

The signs looked familiar - were those the signs from that [2600 magazine](https://www.2600.com/) cover from many many years ago?

2600 magazine has an online [cover gallery](https://www.2600.com/Magazine/CoverGallery) but it's hard to use. I downloaded the covers - and then noticed that the filenames were haphazardly named ("su131.gif", "B004GB1WF6.01._SX275_SCLZZZZZZZ_V323076596_.jpg", etc.)

So I wrote a [throwaway script](3.process.py) to unmangle/rename files.

And yeah -- here's [my picture](4.lexington-53rd-mine.jpg) of the signs and [the cover I was thinking of](7.the-cover.png). Yay! Success. I'm happy.

Also, here are [all of the covers in .zip format](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/2600-covers/raw/main/6.covers.zip).

Oh and I also learned that it's the same station that was 'featured' in [Improv Everywhere](https://improveverywhere.com/)'s "[High Five Escalator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abt8aAB-Dr0)" (read more [here](http://www.projectsubwaynyc.com/blog/2017/1/5/stations-escalators-and-high-fives) too). See this [screengrab](5.lexington-53rd-high-five.png).

## caveat

this repo will go out of date as soon as 2600 magazine publishes another issue.

## huh

this was done on day 0 of my residency at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)
